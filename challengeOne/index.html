                    Hi world!<span class='emoji'>&#128513;</span> 
                    My name is Farai Tanekha. I live in Basildon: a quiet, humble town located in the southern part of Essex.<br/>
                    The town definitely has a lot to offer, but isn't exactly know for producing great talent in the Software development industry.
                    I'm hoping to change that a little. 
                </p>
                <p>

                        <q>Whenever someone asks me about my journey in Software development, 
                            I pretend that I don't know a lot yet
                            because I want it to be a big surprise when I realise my goal to be a full-fledged Software Engineer.
